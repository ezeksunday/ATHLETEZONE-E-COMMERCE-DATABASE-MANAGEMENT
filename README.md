# ATHLETEZONE-E-COMMERCE-DATABASE-MANAGEMENT  

## INTRODUCTION  
This project Exercises provides a series of SQL scripts to manage the core database operations for AthleteZone, an online sports equipment store.  
It covers fundamental SQL commands: CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, demonstrating how to maintain data consistency and integrity in a relational database.  
## Project Structure  
The project is divided into three main lessons, each focusing on a specific SQL operation:  
1. INSERT STATEMENT: Setting up database schema and populating initial data.  
2. UPDATE STATEMENT: Modifying existing records to reflect changes.  
3. DELETE STATEMENT: Removing records from the database.
